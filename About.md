##The Tooth Business: MERN full-stack app assignment
*****************************************


###Purpose

We were approached by our client, the Fairy in Charge(FIC) of Tooth Inc. aka The Tooth Fairy, to create a new full-stack web application. She chose our team to handle this Top Secret project because of our reputation for professionalism and safeguarding sensitive data, mostly thanks to a referral from Santa Claus after we digitised his 'Naughty and Nice List".

This web app will serve two main purposes. Firstly it will be a portal that parents and carers can use to book in a tooth pick-up on the day their child loses a baby tooth. Secondly, it will be a dashboard that the Tooth Fairy can login to manage her company. 

Before hiring us to make this app there was no one place to manage Tooth Inc. If a parent needed to book a tooth pick up they would depend on magic to tell the Tooth Fairy. This worked fine when there were only a few children who believed in her, but as her reputation has grown - mostly thanks to her massive social media following, and the number of children under 6 has shot up to almost 1 billion, magical transmissions became too unpredictable. Furthermore modern parents are accustomed to excellent customer service. They need an app with a secure login that saves all their data, and an easy book in system where they can book, check, edit and cancel an order and get immediate confirmation that they were successful.

While moving from an esoteric to a more practical management system the Tooth Fairy realised, in collaboration with us, that she could streamline her company by moving it online. We decided on a highly secure dashboard where she can view all the daily orders, how many dollars will be outgoing and the total balance of Tooth Inc. It will also show how many deliveries will be done on each continent and give an average rating of each regions manager based on parent reviews. 

####Target Audience
This app will be aimed at parents and carers of children of teeth losing age, as well as the FIC of Tooth Inc.
