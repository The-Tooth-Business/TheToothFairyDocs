##The Tooth Business: MERN full-stack app assignment
*****************************************


###Purpose

We were approached by our client, the Fairy in Charge(FIC) of Tooth Inc. aka The Tooth Fairy, to create a new full-stack web application. She chose our team to handle this Top Secret project because of our reputation for professionalism and safeguarding sensitive data, mostly thanks to a referral from Santa Claus after we digitised his 'Naughty and Nice List".

This web app will serve two main purposes. Firstly it will be a portal that parents and carers can use to book in a tooth pick-up on the day their child loses a baby tooth. Secondly, it will be a dashboard that the Tooth Fairy can login to manage her company. 

Before hiring us to make this app there was no one place to manage Tooth Inc. If a parent needed to book a tooth pick up they would depend on magic to tell the Tooth Fairy. This worked fine when there were only a few children who believed in her, but as her reputation has grown - mostly thanks to her massive social media following, and the number of children under 6 has shot up to almost 1 billion, magical transmissions became too unpredictable. Furthermore modern parents are accustomed to excellent customer service. They need an app with a secure login that saves all their data, and an easy book in system where they can book, check, edit and cancel an order and get immediate confirmation that they were successful.

While moving from an esoteric to a more practical management system the Tooth Fairy realised, in collaboration with us, that she could streamline her company by moving it online. We decided on a highly secure dashboard where she can view all the daily orders, how many dollars will be outgoing and the total balance of Tooth Inc. It will also show how many deliveries will be done on each continent and give an average rating of each regions manager based on parent reviews. 

####Target Audience
This app will be aimed at parents and carers of children of teeth losing age, as well as the FIC of Tooth Inc.


####User Stories

1. As a busy parent I need to organise a Tooth Fairy pick up quickly and easily. Being able to login to a portal where all my details are saved saves me a lot of time.

2. As a parent of an anxious child I need the peace of mind that when I book the Tooth Fairy there will definitly be a pick-up that same night. My child would be so dissapointed to find the tooth still under her pillow in the morning, so I need to receive confirmation that my booking has been successful.

3. As the parent in a chaotic family, we have been known to lose the occasional tooth before the tooth fairy can collect it. In these cases it is reassuring to know that I can login to my personal portal and cancel a tooth collection. 

4. As a parent of twins my boys do everything together, sometimes even lose teeth. I need to be able to update my pick-up order from to one to two or more teeth.

5. As a parent that wants only the best for my child I need to be able to rate and review the service I have received from the Tooth Fairy.

6. As the Fairy in Charge (FIC) of Tooth Inc, an online dashboard is imperative to the successful running of the one biggest organization in Fairyland. 

7. As the Fairy In Charge, the most important thing for me is that my online portal is secure to protect the Top Secret Secret about what I do with all of the teeth.

8. As the Fairy In Charge I am personally responsible for collecting and 'taking care of' the lost baby teeth of every single child on Earth and I need a responsive environment to manage all of the bookings. 

9. As the Fairy In Charge I need all of the daily tooth pick-ups to be automatically collated into an order summary report for the manager of each continent. 

10. As the Fairy In Charge at Tooth Inc, fiscal responsibility is a huge part of my job. Having a place where I can see with a glance how the organisation is positioned makes it easier for me to focus on what is really important. 

11. As the Fairy in Charge I need to easily see how each continent's manager is rating so I can quickly take steps to maintain my good reputation.
