1. As a busy parent I need to organise a Tooth Fairy pick up quickly and easily. Being able to login to a portal where all my details are saved saves me a lot of time.

2. As a parent of an anxious child I need the peace of mind that when I book the Tooth Fairy there will definitly be a pick-up that same night. My child would be so dissapointed to find the tooth still under her pillow in the morning, so I need to receive confirmation that my booking has been successful.

3. Our family is a bit chaotic, and we have been known to lose the occasional tooth before the tooth fairy can collect it. In these cases it is reassuring to know that I can login to my personal portal and cancel a tooth collection. 

4. As a parent of twins my boys do everything together, sometimes even lose teeth. I need to be able to update my pick-up order from to one to two or more teeth.

5. As the Fairy in Charge (FIC) of Tooth Inc an online dashboard is imperative to the successful running of the biggest organization in Fairyland. I am personally responsible for collecting and 'taking care of' the lost baby teeth of every single child on Earth and I need a responsive environment to manage all of the bookings. Every day parents should be able to access our website 'thetoothbusiness.com' where they will sign in and book a tooth pick-up. All of these orders will need to be collated into an order summary report for the manager of each continent. By logging on to the same site as the parents my unique user name and password redirects me to my personal dashboard where this delivery data is automatically updated. 

6. As the FIC at Tooth Inc, fiscal responsibility is a huge part of my job. Having a place where I can see with a glance how the organisation is positioned makes it easier for me to focus on what is really important. 'What is that, you ask?' The smiles of children of course! After logging onto my personal dashboard, I want to see the total balance of the company easily, as well as the nightly outgoings which should be automatically calculated based on how many teeth have been booked to be collected. These two figures should update daily to reflect the previous day.
