1. As a busy parent I need to organise a Tooth Fairy pick up quickly and easily. Being able to login to a portal where all my details are saved saves me a lot of time.

2. As a parent of an anxious child I need the peace of mind that when I book the Tooth Fairy there will definitly be a pick-up that same night. My child would be so dissapointed to find the tooth still under her pillow in the morning, so I need to receive confirmation that my booking has been successful.

3. As the parent in a chaotic family, we have been known to lose the occasional tooth before the tooth fairy can collect it. In these cases it is reassuring to know that I can login to my personal portal and cancel a tooth collection. 

4. As a parent of twins my boys do everything together, sometimes even lose teeth. I need to be able to update my pick-up order from to one to two or more teeth.

5. As a parent that wants only the best for my child I need to be able to rate and review the service I have received from the Tooth Fairy.

6. As the Fairy in Charge (FIC) of Tooth Inc, an online dashboard is imperative to the successful running of the one biggest organization in Fairyland. 

7. As the Fairy In Charge, the most important thing for me is that my online portal is secure to protect the Top Secret Secret about what I do with all of the teeth.

8. As the Fairy In Charge I am personally responsible for collecting and 'taking care of' the lost baby teeth of every single child on Earth and I need a responsive environment to manage all of the bookings. 

9. As the Fairy In Charge I need all of the daily tooth pick-ups to be automatically collated into an order summary report for the manager of each continent. 

10. As the Fairy In Charge at Tooth Inc, fiscal responsibility is a huge part of my job. Having a place where I can see with a glance how the organisation is positioned makes it easier for me to focus on what is really important. 

11. As the Fairy in Charge I need to easily see how each continent's manager is rating so I can quickly take steps to maintain my good reputation.
